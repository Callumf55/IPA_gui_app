# LAMP-IPA
This is the code (LAMP_to_IPA.py) used to combine the raw data (df_pos_not_clustered) and the LAMP output (anno_summ_IPA) into a dataframe useable for the IPA tool (annotated_IPA_DF).
The ipa_run_pipeline and the gui are a basic way for people to run the full ipa pipeline without having to interact with the code. This is just a basic gui and can have things such as a progress bar added. The inspiration for this gui came from the LAMP gui.
